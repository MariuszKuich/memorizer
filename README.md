## A cute little application for memorizing things
It lets you split your notes into small chunks.\
One random information chunk is sent to your email every day.\
This way you can finally learn all the things you noted down by reading one short email daily.

For running this application locally you'll need:
* PostgreSQL database,
* Apache Kafka.

For configuration details see the `application.yml` file.
